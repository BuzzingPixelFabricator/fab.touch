# Fabricator Assets Loading Component

While this component is designed with the [BuzzingPixel Fabricator Build Process](https://github.com/tjdraper/buzzing-pixel-fabricator) in mind, it can be used anywhere (in theory).

The Fabricator touch API currently only has one method, and that is to check if the current device is a touchscreen or not.

## `FAB.touch.support();`

Returns a boolean.
